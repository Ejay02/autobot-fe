## Project Overview

The Autobot Frontend is designed to display real-time data from the backend service, which creates and manages Autobotsâ€”users that generate posts and comments on a social media platform. The frontend provides an interface to view the number of Autobots created, along with their posts and comments.

### Features

- **Real-time Autobot Count Dashboard**:
  - Displays the number of Autobots created by the backend.
  - Uses WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates.
- **Responsive UI**:

  - Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Interactive Components**:
  - View and interact with posts and comments made by the Autobots.

## Installation

To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autobot-fe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd autobot-frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables (e.g., API base URL).

   ```bash
   VITE_BE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```

## Usage

npm run dev
```

This will run the application on `http://localhost:5173`. Open it in your browser to view the app.
